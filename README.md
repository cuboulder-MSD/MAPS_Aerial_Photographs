# Aerial Photographs of Colorado
## Description
Aerial Photographs of Colorado collection metadata from the University of Colorado Boulder. 

Aerial photographs dramatically portray the changing landscape of Colorado: a mountain valley can be seen where there is now a reservoir; changes in the vegetation and ground cover can be traced over the years, and the growth of towns and cities documented. This collection provides access to more than 2,800 aerial photographs of Colorado taken by the U.S. Forest Service, Soil Conservation Service, and Agricultural Adjustment Administration from 1936 to 1947. Each photograph is identified by a project or county code followed by the roll and frame numbers assigned by the photographing agency.

## Notes
Sequence numbers on the images:
The older (1930s, 1940s) images typically have a handwritten date in one corner, and a code in the other corner.  The code can denote multiple things:

County: the letter code can possibly designate a county.
https://www.fsa.usda.gov/Internet/FSA_File/catalogpdf.pdf  - list of counties and projects from the FDA - county codes are in parentheses next to the county name.  
The county code was used for the Colorado Springs Aerial Photographs - YL denotes El Paso County, and the series number and sequence is stamped next to it.  
Sometimes the code (BOW, BOV) is used to note the flight number, or some kind of information about the company doing the flight.  In this case, some digging through archived government records may be necessary, as direct references to precisely what this number means are lacking online.  

Fun fact:
In some of the photos, what looks like topographical lines can be seen on the landscape.  These are plow lines that were done by the Soil Conservation Service in the 1920s to help mitigate soil movement due to overuse (the "Dust Bowl") or lack of vegetation in general to hold the soil in place.  These lines can still be seen in some undeveloped areas (notably east of Fountain, CO) in modern satellite imagery.
